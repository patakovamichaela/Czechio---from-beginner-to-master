#this is my solution of Chekio mission Xs and Os Referee (https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/x-o-referee/)

"""Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces
in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows
(NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game
and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X"
if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D"."""
